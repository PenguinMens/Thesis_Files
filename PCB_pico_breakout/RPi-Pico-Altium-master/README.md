# Altium Library for Raspberry Pi Pico board

The footprint is made using custom pads with rounded shape as described in the board's datasheet, and also includes pads for test points.

## TODO

* [ ] Draw mounting holes of the Pico board on the Mech-13 layer (or add a new footprint with drilled ones).
* [ ] Add miled holes under micro-USB socket (for better soldering) as it is described in the board's datasheet.
* [ ] Make GND pads rounded rectangular as on the Pico board.
